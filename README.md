# Catastrophic Forgetting Visualizations

This branch serves interactive visualizations demonstrating catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.

## Available Visualizations

The visualizations are hosted via GitHub Pages and demonstrate different aspects of catastrophic forgetting:

- **Linear Classifier**: Basic demonstration of catastrophic forgetting with a simple linear model
- **MLP Classifier**: Multi-layer perceptron showing catastrophic forgetting effects
- **4-Class MLP**: Advanced example with multiple tasks demonstrating true task-specific catastrophic forgetting

## Accessing the Visualizations

Once deployed, the visualizations will be available at the GitHub Pages URL for this repository.

## About

These visualizations are part of a research project exploring catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, providing interactive demonstrations of how neural networks can "forget" previously learned tasks when learning new ones.
