# Development Plan: Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation Strategies

## Overview

This document outlines the next development phases for our catastrophic forgetting research framework. We will build interactive visualizations demonstrating various strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting, progressing from basic approaches to cutting-edge architectural solutions.

## Current State

âœ… **Completed:**
- Linear classifier catastrophic forgetting demonstration
- MLP visualization with weight tracking
- Interactive 3-phase training workflow
- Real-time decision boundary and weight evolution

## Phase 1: Basic Mitigation Strategies

### 1.1 Joint Training Visualization
**Goal:** Show that training on all data simultaneously prevents forgetting

**Implementation:**
- Extend existing MLP visualization
- Add "Joint Training" mode that combines Dataset 1 + Dataset 2
- Compare side-by-side: Sequential vs Joint training
- Metrics: Accuracy on both datasets throughout training

**Key Insights:**
- Joint training maintains performance on all tasks
- Weight evolution shows stable representations
- Demonstrates the "ideal" but impractical solution

### 1.2 Experience Replay
**Goal:** Visualize how storing and replaying old examples helps

**Implementation:**
- Add replay buffer visualization
- Show subset of Dataset 1 being replayed during Dataset 2 training
- Animate buffer contents and replay frequency
- Compare performance with different buffer sizes

**Key Insights:**
- Small replay buffers can significantly reduce forgetting
- Buffer size vs. performance trade-offs
- Memory efficiency considerations

## Phase 2: Regularization Techniques

### 2.1 Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
**Goal:** Show how importance-weighted regularization preserves critical weights

**Implementation:**
- Visualize Fisher Information Matrix calculation
- Color-code weights by importance
- Show EWC loss components during training
- Compare weight changes with/without EWC

**Key Insights:**
- Important weights for Task 1 are protected during Task 2 training
- EWC balances old vs new task performance
- Regularization strength effects on forgetting

### 2.2 Synaptic Intelligence

- Compare capacity utilization across tasks

**Key Insights:**
- No forgetting by design (separate capacity per task)
- Knowledge transfer through lateral connections
- Scaling challenges with many tasks

### 3.2 PackNet
**Goal:** Demonstrate structured sparsity for task isolation

**Implementation:**
- Visualize network pruning after Task 1
- Show weight allocation (free vs. assigned to Task 1)
- Animate Task 2 training on remaining capacity
- Compare compression ratios and performance

**Key Insights:**
- Iterative pruning creates task-specific subnetworks
- Capacity allocation strategies
